- Analysis
    - create TrieNode and Trie structure containing function of insertion and checking.
    - add suffix function by recurse leave word in trie 

- Complexity
    - basic function(insertion and checking)
        - Time: O(n), linear time to the length of word
        - Space: O(n), the space of the length of word
    - suffix function 
        - Time: O(depth * width) recurse search all character saved
        - Space: O(all words), all the word exits
