- Analysis
    - utilize merge sort to divide list into two descending lists
    - traverse number in these two descending lists from first to last separately to push into other two lists each time a number 

- Complexity
    - Time: O(n*log(n)), same as merge sort time complexity 
    - Space: O(n*log(n)), new list is created in every sort round
