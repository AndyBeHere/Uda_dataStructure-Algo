- my solution
    - use bfs recursion to traverse the group in every hierarchy of groups
    - termination condition is: if user is in the group or all hierarchy of groups are traversed

- time complexity
    - o(n) (n is amount of all groups and users under the input group)

- space complexity
    - o(1) (no data is stored)
